In JavaScript, `let`, `var`, and `const` are all keywords used to declare variables, but they **differ significantly** in terms of scope, initialization rules, whether they can be redeclared or reassigned and the behavior when they are accessed before declaration:


| Behavior                         | `var`          | `let`              | `const`             |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Scope                            | Function or Global | Block           | Block               |
| Initialization                   | Optional       | Optional           | Required            |
| Redeclaration                    | Yes            | No                 | No                  |
| Reassignment                     | Yes            | Yes                | No                  |
| Accessing before declaration     | `undefined`    | `ReferenceError`   | `ReferenceError`    |

> Note: Block statements Like `if` and `switch` conditions or `for` and `while` loops, unlike functions, donâ€™t create a new scope. 
Variables defined inside of a block statement will **remain** in the scope they were already in. 

### Scope
- `var`: scoped to the function in which they are created, or if created outside of any function, to the global object.
- `let` or `const`: block scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest set of curly braces (function, if-else block, or for-loop).

<JsEditor initCode={`if (true) {
  var bar = 1;
  let baz = 2;
  const qux = 3;
}

// var variables are accessible anywhere in the function scope.
console.log(bar); // 1
// let and const variables are not accessible outside of the block they were defined in.
console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: baz is not defined
console.log(qux); // ReferenceError: qux is not defined
`}/>

### Initialization
- `var` or `let`: can be initialized without a value
- `const`: declarations must be initialized.

```jsx
var foo; // Ok
let bar; // Ok
const baz; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
```

### Redeclaration
- `var`: will **not** throw an error
- `let` or `const`: will throw error

```jsx
var foo = 1;
var foo = 2;
console.log(foo); // 2

let baz = 3;
let baz = 4; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'baz' has already been declared
```

### Reassignment
- `var` or `let`: Allows reassignment
- `const`: throws error

```jsx
let bar = 3;
bar = 4; // This is fine.

const baz = 5;
baz = 6; // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

### Accessing before declaration
- Only declartaion for all `var`, `let` and `const` is hoisted.
- `var` declared variables are auto-initialized with an `undefined` value.
- Accessing `let` or `const` before the declaration will result in a ReferenceError exception.

```jsx
console.log(foo); // undefined
var foo = 'foo';

console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'baz' before initialization
let baz = 'baz';

console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'bar' before initialization
const bar = 'bar';
```
